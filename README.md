Beep boop, Andre is a robot ðŸ¤– ...

Well not really. Actually [far from it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams). Nonetheless, the idea of having an [instruction manual on how to work with a human](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) fascinates me. So besides the usual and obivious (such as `Handle With Care`, and `Tumble Dry Only`), here are some tips and tricks on working with me.

## We are all human

Perhaps the most important tip on this README, so I guess we can start here. We are all human. Duh. But I take that to heart. <u>I am a very empathic person</u>.

Not that I value that trait over others, that's just how I am. That means I find it easy to connect with people. But also means I can be emotionaly sensitive: bad energy from others can disrupt my mood and focus.

For you the takeaway is that I'm always available as a human. I understand life comes before work. I'm a good listener. Feel free to share when you want to vent, or ask for space when you need it. Which segways nicely to my next tip.

## Talk to me

Do it. I like talking and I like listening. I value communication. I dislike surprises. I need your feedback.

Have any questions? Talk to me. Concerned about something? Talk to me. Something you were responsible for went wrong? Talk to me.

Being a distributed first company has its challenges and high up there is communication. Overcommunicating should be the goal every time.

## Do what got you here

The team chose you. You chose to be here. The team is expecting you to do what was agreed upon when those decisions where made. Make sure you do that.

This does not mean I like my peers to stick to their areas of expertise only (see below). But it means that above all you were probably added to the team for a particular set of skills you possess. Make sure that you take care of that, the team is depending on it. You can always contribute in other areas, but the team can't guarantee that someone else will cover what you are considered responsible for.

## What got you here won't get you there (don't be afraid to experiment)

## Trust the expertise of others

## OCD is a serious disorder

And I think it is sad people use that term to describe people who appreciates neatness and order. I do not have OCD. But working with me you might find that I really appreciate an organized workspace.

Tabs or spaces, it does not matter: what matters is consistancy. Linters are great. Take the extra time for polishing. Leave things better than you find them. The `Broken Windows Theory` might not be great under [criminology context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory#Criticism) but it certainly applies well in the work environment. Let's all be reponsible for fixing our broken windows.

## Small talk carries context
