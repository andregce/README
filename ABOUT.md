Hi! Oi! Hola! I’m André. 

I was born and raised in a small town in Brazil called Poços de Caldas (state of Minas Gerais), but I’ve spent most of my life in South Florida (anywhere between West Palm and Ft. Lauderdale). I’m currently living in Sarasota, FL, a small town just south of Tampa.

I’ve been a tinkerer since I was a little kid. I knew I wanted to work with computers ever since my family bought our first one, back in the early 90s. I was fascinated by the idea that machine instructions could be converted into interactable programs. I started learning QBasic (mostly by tinkering with [GORILLA.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)) and [NIBBLES.BAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(video_game))). After finishing High School in Brazil I moved to the US and earned a Computer Engineering degree from Florida Atlantic University. Since graduation I’ve worked with both hardware and software, both as a software engineer and product manager.

### Fun Facts

- I love music of every variety. I sing (poorly) and play the guitar. My favorite band is The Beatles.
- I speak 3 languages (Portuguese, Spanish, and English) and I love learning new ones.
- I love entertaining and cooking for a crowd. Either at my kitchen or at a grill, I’m comfortable feeding dozens at a time.
- My wife and I got married in 2018 and we are expecting our first baby! 
- I can be easily [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/). I consider jigsaw puzzles a competitive sport.
- I believe there is always a relevant XKCD (see above).
- I've been an Airbnb Superhost for 5 years. Check out my [house in Kissimmee, FL](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4736497) next time you want to go see Mickey!
